# KobeCodeQuiz

Hello! Welcome to my Kobe Code Quiz! As a basketball fan of only about 5-6 years, I only caught the end of Kobe's spectacular career with the Lakers. Unfortunately, he has passed and I felt I am doing myself a disservice, as an NBA fan, by not knowing enough about Kobe. So, to get two things done at once, I decided to make this quiz about Kobe to learn about him and practice my coding skills. In addition, I added some cool rules with the timer to honor the numbers Kobe wore. (8 and 24)

<ol><strong>RULES</strong
  <li>You start with 24 seconds on the clock</li>
  <li>For each correct button click you GAIN 8 seconds</li>
  <li>For each incorrect button click you LOSE 8 seconds</li></ol><br><br>

<ul><strong>Technologies/techniques utilized:</strong>
  <li>HTML5</li>
  <li>CSS3</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Local Storage</li>
  <li>DOM control</li>
